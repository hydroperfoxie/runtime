# AS34HT

AS34HT is the implementation of the Steel ActionScript 3 engine in a JavaScript module.

AS34HT may run in two environments: a HyperText Markup Language engine or in the Node JavaScript runtime, in particular because the Steel engine supports Single Page Applications that support the server side rendering, and certain programming interfaces are available either in the client side, the server side, or both.

In addition, the full ActionScript 3, MXML and CSS3 language series are compiled by the Steel MXML compiler based in the [MXMLExtrema organization](https://github.com/mxmlextrema).
