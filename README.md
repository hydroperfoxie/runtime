# Runtime

The runtime is the implementation of the Steel ActionScript 3 engine in a JavaScript module.

The runtime may is implemented for two environments: a HyperText Markup Language (HTML) engine and the Node.js runtime. In particular Single Page Applications support server side rendering, and certain programming interfaces are available either in the client side, the server side, or both.

In addition, the full ActionScript 3, MXML and CSS3 language series are compiled by the Steel MXML compiler based in the [MXMLExtrema organization](https://github.com/mxmlextrema).
